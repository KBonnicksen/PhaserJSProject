Before I landed on Phaser I had wanted to work with React. After following the beginnings of a couple tutorials I decided I will incorporate React into one of my later projects instead (there seems to be a lot to learn there and I'll go into that when I have more time on my hands). 

I toyed around with three JS a bit and decided I did not want to do that either.

I found a couple of video tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8a8-SO6vP0) that walk you through creating a game with phaser js but decided to mainly work directly with Phasers documentation and Richard Davey's (of photonstorm) written tutorial. (https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1).
